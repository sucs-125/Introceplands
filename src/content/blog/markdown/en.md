# This is a Level 1 heading

## This is a Level 2 heading

### This is a Level 3 heading

#### This is a Level 4 heading

#### This is a Level 5 heading
```

Separate paragraphs with blank lines. Do not use spaces or indentation before paragraphs.

```markdown

```

### Line Breaks

Add two or more spaces at the end of a line to force a line break.

```markdown
This is the first line  
This is the second line
```

```

## Block Quotes

Precede words or phrases with a right arrow `>` to create block quotes, ensuring they are separated by spaces.

```markdown
> What you dwell on will echo back!

### Nested Block Quotes

Precede paragraphs with double right arrows `>>` to create nested quotes.

Enclose words or phrases with backticks ` to denote code.

```

### Code Blocks

Enclose code blocks with three backticks (``) or three tilde symbols (~~~) on both sides, and specify the language type after the first line for syntax highlighting.

````
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout<<“Hello World!”<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```
````

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout<<“Hello World!”<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Lists

### Ordered Lists

Precede paragraphs with a number followed by a period `.` to create an ordered list. Numbers don't need to be sequential, but the list will display with numbers at the beginning.

```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
```

```markdown
- First item

* Second item
  . Third item
```

Displays as:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Nesting List Items

To nest another element (paragraph, blockquote, etc.) within a list item, indent it by four spaces or one tab.

```markdown
1. First item
   > Early to bed, early to rise
2. Second item
```

Displays as:

1. First item
   > Early to bed, early to rise
2. Second item

## Links

### Linking

```markdown
Welcome to Motues' [Blog](https://motues.top)!
```

Welcome to Motues' [Blog](https://motues.top)!

### Link Titles

Add a title in the brackets after the URL. This will display as a tooltip when users hover over the link.

```markdown
Welcome to Motues' [Blog](https://motues.top “Motues' Blog”)!
```

Displayed as:

## Images

Start with an exclamation mark (!), then add alternative text in parentheses. Include the image resource path or URL within the parentheses. Optionally, add a title after the URL in the parentheses.The title will be displayed below the image.

```markdown
![Motues](./Motues.png "This is my avatar")
```

Displayed as:  
![Motues](./Motues.png "This is my avatar")
<!-- <img src="./Motues.png" alt="Motues" title="This is my avatar" width="256" height="256"> -->

## Tables

### Table

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column header, and separate columns with vertical bars (`|`) (rows and columns do not need to be aligned).

```markdown
| Fruit      | Color    | Taste      |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Watermelon🍉 | Green | Sweet  |
| Grapes🍇 | Purple | Tart  |
```

Displayed as:
| Fruit      | Color      | Taste      |
| ---------- | ---------| ----|
| Watermelon🍉 | Green | Sweet |
| Grapes🍇 | Purple | Tart |

### Alignment

You can align text within a column to the left, right, or center by adding a colon `:` to the left, right, or both sides of the hyphen in the header row.

```markdown
| Fruit   | Color | Taste |
| :----- | :--: | ---: |
| Watermelon🍉 | Green | Sweet |
| Grapes🍇 | Purple | Tart |
```

Displayed as:
| Fruit | Color | Taste |
| :------ | :-----:| ----:|
| Watermelon🍉 | Green | Sweet |
| Grapes🍇 | Purple | Tart |

### Escape Characters

Use the HTML character code `&#124;` to display the vertical bar `|` character in tables.

## Task Lists

Precede each task item with a hyphen `-` and square brackets `[]`, inserting a space between them. To mark a task as completed, add an `x` inside the brackets.

```markdown
- [x] Eat
- [ ] Sleep
- [ ] Play Beans
```

- [x] Eat
- [ ] Sleep
- [ ] Play Beans

## Other Features
